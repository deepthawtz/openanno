Hey there,

Thanks for annotating everything! Your API key is <%=api_key%>

Open your shell right now and annotate the "example_object" with a high awesome factor:
(feel free to pimp this to your liking, it's an open annotation world):

curl -i -X POST -d '{"example_type":{"awesome_factor":"10"}}'  \
      http://openanno.com/api/example_object?api_key=<%=api_key%>

To pull all annotations on this object do this:

curl http://openanno.com/api/sample_object

Take a look at http://openanno.com/docs for a tutorial and stuff like that.

Stay awesome! We swear to not abuse your email address and such.

Cheers
